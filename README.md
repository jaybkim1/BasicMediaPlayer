# BasicMediaPlayer

This project is an example that I attempt to show how to work with audio and video elementary streams and synchronize them with each other.

I used a simple trick to sync audio with video (audio based)

I hope this helps someone who is struggling to discover how to synchronize audio and video.


## How To Use

1. Have a sample .mp4 file in any directory of your device

2. Clone this project and go to Player class and change String "SAMPLE" variable with your path.

3. Run it ! 

* Since this is just a sample project, I did not put any codes for permission. 
  For those who use above Android 6.0 (API level 23), i suggest you to go to grant permission manually in settings.
